                I revisited some songs from my favorite band of all time: Phoenix.
                I first "discovered them" after listening to Birdy's cover of one of their songs (1901) and one day realized that 1901 was actually from Phoenix and not from Birdy. The I finally started listening to Phoenix and the rest is history. I've been a fan of them for at least 14 years.
                I also love soundtracks so clearly you can see the Virgin Suicides' album and a 60's italian movie score. 
                Because I'm learning Italian, I like to be imerged in the language through music, so Angelia Mango is a great artist to listen to.
                Then we have the classic: Bad Bunny. To be honest I don't listen to many of his songs but there are a few that are nice.
                I also listened to the queen herself: Björk. I LOVE her music.
                Caroline Polacheck is also a great artist, JUST restarted listening to her.
                Then we have Clairo and Coco&ClairClair (maybe I am truly a genz). No, actually, I'm just an elder Gen z and time is catching up to me. I FEEL SO OLD (╯_╰).
