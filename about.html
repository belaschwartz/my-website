            <p>
                Hi friend! I'm Bells (she/her). I'm an Art Historian in the making (aka still in college lol) and I have a plethora of hobbies, but creating my own website is a new venture of mine. 
                My favorite hobbies include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> sewing</li>
                <li> reading </li>
                <li> scrapbooking </li>  
                <li> watching movies </li>  
            </ul>
            <p>
                I have a 4 year-old black cat called Kiki (yes from Kiki's Delivery Service!) and she is the sweetest kitty.
                <!-- ADD PICTURE OF KIKI HERE -->
                Because I am slowly learning HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT, this website might look chaotic and very clunky! So I have to apologize for the mess. 
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for stoping by!</p>
