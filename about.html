               A little bit about myself:
               I am an Art History student who is almost graduating (I can't wait to be done with uni). My partner and I have a little a black cat named Kiki, and we are both very much couch potatoes. I am learning Italian (B2 level) and I love it. I've been to Italy 3 times and I love the people, the art and the food. I currently don't have a ton of time to update this website but once I am done with college, I'll finally be able to have free evenings and get better at coding. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Creating my own website is a new venture of mine, and to be honest, coding never interested me. However, after I learned about the revival of the old web, I thought it would be amazing to have an online space where I can costumize it however I like. It has been nice to hop from one neocities website to the next and see everyone's incredible creations. This is just a little space for me to share things I like and learn how to make a cute website.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong> Now for the most important thing:</strong> Kiki. She is the reason why I named my wesbite "Kiki and the Cats" (it's actually a dumb play on words related to Elton John's song "Bennie and the Jets). Kiki is a very sweet cat and she makes my days better.
                Here she is in all her glory and splendor.

            <p>
                Because I am slowly learning HTML and CSS, this website might look chaotic and very clunky! So I have to apologize for the mess.
