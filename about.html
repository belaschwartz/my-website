            Hi friend! Call me Bells (she/her). I'm and Art Historian in the making (aka still in college lol) and I have a plethora of hobbies, including a brand new one: creating my own website. 
            My favorite hobbies include sewing, reading, scrapbooking and watching movies.
            I have a 4 year-old black cat called Kiki (yes from Kiki's Delivery Service!) and she is the sweetest kittie.
             <!-- ADD PICTURE OF KIKI HERE -->
            I am still in college, and I am studying Art History - so you might see a couple of art history related articles in here.
            I also really love fashion history.
            Please come explore my wesite and have fun!

            Thank you for stoping by!
        </p>
