            <p>
                Hi friend! I'm Bells (she/her). I'm an Art Historian in the making and I have a plethora of hobbies.Creating my own website is a new venture of mine. 
                My favorite hobbies include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> sewing</li>
                <li> reading </li>
                <li> taking pictures with my little point and shoot camera </li>  
                <li> watching movies </li>  
            </ul>
            <p>
                To be honest, coding never interested me. However, after I learned about the revival of the old web, I thought it would be amazing to have an online space where I can costumize it however I like. It's not that I am against social media, but it has been nice to hop from one neocities website to the next and see everyone's incredible creations. This is just a little place for me to share things I like and learn how to make a cute little site.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong> Now for the most important thing:</strong> I have a 4 year-old black cat called Kiki. She is the very sweet but oh my, she can be a menace sometimes.
                Here she is in all her glory and splendor. 
                <img src="images/kiki by the window.jpeg">
                Because I am slowly learning HTML and CSS, this website might look chaotic and very clunky! So I have to apologize for the mess. 
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for stoping by!</p>
